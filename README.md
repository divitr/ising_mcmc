# 2-D Ising Model Markov Chain Monte Carlo Simulation

This project was completed as a part of the UC Berkeley Physics Directed Reading Progra Fall 2023, under the mentorship of Kai Klocke.

An Ising model is created with underlying parameters beta and H, and simulated using MCMC. Training data is collected, and an SVR model is trained to predict beta and H from summary statistics of the model.
